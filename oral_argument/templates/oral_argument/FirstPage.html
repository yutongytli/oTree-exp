    <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

        You are invited to take part in a research study. Before you decide to be a part of this study, you need to understand
    the risks and benefits. This consent form provides information about the research study. This process is known as informed
    consent. Your decision to take part in the study is voluntary. You are free to choose whether or not you will take part
    in the study.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Information About Participants' Involvement in the Study</strong></p>
    <p>
        The research will be conducted over the online platform Amazon Mechanical Turk in an hour-long session. Within the
    session, you will be asked to participate in series of speech and language processing tasks and to fill out a set of
    questionnaires. You can terminate the experiment at any time. Withdrawing from the study will not result in any negative
    consequences for you.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Risks</strong></p>
    <p>
        Your participation poses minimal risks to you. Your answers will be kept confidential and your responses will not be
    linked to you personally; they will be reported as a group.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>
    <p>
    There is no immediate benefit to you. A better understanding of the speech perception and production may help identify
    potential obstacles in first/second language acquisition, which in turn may help improving language teaching pedagogy.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Confidentiality</strong></p>
    <p>
    The information in the study records will be kept confidential. Data will be stored securely and will be made available only
    to persons conducting the study unless participants specifically give permission in writing to do otherwise. No reference
    will be made in oral or written reports which could link participants to the study.
    </p>
