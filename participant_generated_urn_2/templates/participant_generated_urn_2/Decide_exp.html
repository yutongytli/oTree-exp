    <p>
        Now please consider the following four different bets. These, and thus your possible earnings, depend on the
        throw of the standard coin and the symbol of ball drawn from the urn.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please specify for each bet what you think its value is. In other words, if you could buy the bet, how much
        would you maximally pay for it? Please enter a value between $0.00 and $1.00.
    </p>
    <p>
        You are not buying these bets, instead you will receive the bet for which you indicated the highest value, for
        free (if you assign the same highest value to two or more bets, the bet which is listed first below is what you
        will get). The session continues as follows: The computer generates the coin throw, and also the computer draws a ball from the urn.
        Depending on the combination of the coin and the ball then you personally either win $1.00 or nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
        While everything in the experiment is anonymous, there is one exception. On the next screen, we will show you
        the contents of the urn as well as your payoff.
