        Instructions

    <p>
        In this experiment you will decide whether you prefer to play a lottery, in which the payoff is dependent on the
        color of a ball randomly drawn from a drum, or to receive a guaranteed amount of money.
    </p>

    <p>
        Before it starts, you need to choose one of the envelopes. Each envelope contains a random number from 0.00 to
        1.00. All possible numbers have equal probability. <strong>These numbers are randomly preselected by the computer
        and will remain the same all through the experiment.</strong>.
        Once experiment 2 is over, we will give you a password to open your envelope on the third party website:
        <a href="{{ link }}" target=_blank>https://www.browserling.com/tools/aes-decrypt</a>. Then you can get your result.
